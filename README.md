Introduction to the Project
I worked on this project as part of my mid-bootcamp-project during a Data Analytics course at Ironhack Coding School.

Instructions
You are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

Objective
The task is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.
